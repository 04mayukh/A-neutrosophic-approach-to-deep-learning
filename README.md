The above code was executed in google Colab.
Instructions for using:
1. Copy the files into your Google drive.
2. Add GloVe embeddings and dataset files to the drive. You may need to make changes in paths in the code.
3. The embeddings are available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NAwZCxTUMJdz7VywIT1VHhDKDKVxgtOG/view?usp=sharing)
4. Open the python notebook on Colab where it can be executed.
5. The code has been run on tensorflow 1.x and may not work as expected on tensorflow 2.x
